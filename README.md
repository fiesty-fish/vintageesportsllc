Discussing features, specifically low hanging fruit, if members want to work on them individually from home.
Review our overall schema, walk through changes of the day, and see how said low hanging fruit work into that before tackling it after hours.

# Team Expectations:

Coding best practices - document your code with comments, keep it simple, keep it dry, long and descriptive variable names are welcomed, semicolons are encouraged, css is saved to separate files. Basic design until tier 2 with pure css. After that, we will reconvene and decide if 100% pure or pure&materialui/bootstrap.

Timeout is our key word. We stop everything and talk about the subject at hand to get a better understanding of it if someone says timeout.

Every one of us has their own style of programming, we will be respectful of each other’s styles.

Work together on Saturday as a full day, Sunday is voluntary depending on how we’re doing with the project at that point in time. We will address Sunday (Father’s Day) on the Friday stand up meeting.

Work day ends at 6pm officially, up to the discretion of the team member whether to stay after that time.
Working after hours, whether on campus or from home, is up to the team members discretion.
Team members will be sensitive to where the project is at given the timeline, and will be open to changes that will be agreed upon as a group at the daily retrospective.
